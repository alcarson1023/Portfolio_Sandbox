CTRL + SHIFT + P -> Python: Create Environment
    Creates new venv

.venv\Scripts\activate
    Activates the venv (run from "Python/Portfolio")

FOR DEVELOPMENT -
    python app.py
        Launches the backend on localhost:5000
    npm run start-backend
        Launches a version of the backend that updates as I save files.

    npm start
        Launches the frontend on localhost:3000

FOR PRODUCTION -
    flask run
        Launches a development server? Not sure how this differs.
            The main difference is that python app.py directly executes
            the Python script, while flask run relies on the Flask command-line
            interface (CLI) and automatically detects the Flask app.

    npm run build
        Creates a build in the build folder. Copy > Paste this over the static/build folder.

    

I've added the following to package.json, may need to remove it later.
    "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
